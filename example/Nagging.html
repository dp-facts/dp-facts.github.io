        <h2>Nagging</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>- <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong> refers to a manipulative pattern that, once used, results in consequences similar to this: 
                the user tries to do something, but they are persistently interrupted by requests to do something else that may not be in their best interests.</p>
            <p>- When you're persistently interrupted, you're more likely to give in and end up engaging in behaviors that aren't beneficial for you. In real-world, you're likely to eventually allow the website to send notifications to you, resulting in numerous unwanted promotional messages being displayed. It's akin to falling into a trap of distractions, or perhaps even being tricked into wasting more time.  </p>
            <p><h3>Real-world example #1:</h3> In 2018, Instagram aggressively nagged users to turn on notifications, repeating this regularly over a period of months. Users were not able to reject the request entirely – their only option to reject was "Not Now", which allowed the <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong> to continue.</p>

            <p><h3>Real-world example #2:</h3> Google repeatedly asks user for permission to use location data, only allowing “don’t show me again” to be selected if permission is given, pestering the user until they give permission.</p>
